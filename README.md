## Meeting notes
- Client has the logo

- Likes following websites of their competitors: [AutoBoutique](http://autoboutique.cars.ua/) and [Ukr-Prokat](https://ukr-prokat.com/)
- Provides both selling and renting car services. It should be two separate pages/categories
- "CAR'S GALLERY" - name of the business
- Booking - simple model, just ask for a phone number, name and send a notification to owner (by Email?)
- Terms of rent - they have a document with [rental terms](pages/terms/en.md), should make a page with that
- Rental agreement - they wanted to post a full rental agreement, but it's not ready yet. Reserve a link for it (in footer, probably)
- Contacts - there should be a page with all contacts

  - [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/rent_carsgallery_od/)
- Cars should have a picture (upload) and youtube videos (embed)
- Labels for cars - they should be able to add following labels to the car postings: "New arrival", "Sale" ("Новинка", "Акция")
- carsgallery.com.ua - that's the domain name that they decided on
- About company - create a page with the [company description](pages/about/en.md) (make links from "call", "come to office", etc.)
- Internationalization - English, Russian and Ukrainian
- Callback hunter ([binotel/getcall](http://www.binotel.ua/getcall))
- Only USD currency
- No car categories
- Rental price will vary depending on the rent duration: 1-7 days, 8-29 days and 30+ days.

## Notes
- On the buy/rent car page, I do not want to show "color" and "city" parameters.
  - Color should be clearly seen on the pictures. While adding this parameter might be really tricky, requiring to include all colors and their translations.
  - Business currently operates only in Odessa, so there is no point of adding "city" parameter. And it has same drawbacks, as the "color" parameter.
